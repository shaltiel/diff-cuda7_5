dR,dZ: are grid minimum difference. 
g_r, g_z: are expansion factor for the grids.
K_bv: is the butler-volmer kinetic constant.
SR: scan rate of voltammetry.

steps: if it equals 0 it makes a full cycle from potential -20 up to 20 and back to -20, 
for a test, can just put small value (e.g. 10) for  few number of steps).
